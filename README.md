# FOSSmaster


FOSSmaster is an app that helps you get started with the Open Source World. You can view info about your current repos & starred repos on Github, manage your Pull Requests, view feed from the people you are following. You can find repos to start your contribution to Open Source by selecting the programming language you are intersted in and the difficulty level of that project.

Very soon we would be adding many new features..... So stay tuned and contribute to Open Source.

Any new suggestions and improvements are welcomed..!!!

The algorithm used to implement cluster repos into tough medium and hard of repos is using machine learning unsupervide learning Knn cluster.
